==============================================================================

Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable is a Net::DNS::Resolver descendant class that
allows a virtual DNS to be emulated instead of querying the real DNS.  A set of
static DNS records may be supplied, or arbitrary code may be specified as a
means for retrieving DNS records, or even generating them on the fly.
